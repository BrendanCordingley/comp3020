Jen is a single mother at the age of 45. She works full time and has 3 children which she picks up from school every day after work.
Her children's ages range from 11-13 years old. Before Jen cooks dinner, she generaly wants some time to sit down and relax.
Her children are often quite loud, so Jen likes to put on a movie to help keep them quiete. Jen always makes sure that the movie she
plays is appropiate for her children and educational. Jen doesnt have a lot of experience using computer software, but thankfully
the movie organizer software she has is simple enough that she can find a movie that fits all her requirements. Jens children focus
on the tv and Jen can finally relax.
